# RCode
A simple code I made in school that shifts characters over by 2.
## What?
This is a secret code I made in school. It works by shifter characters over by 2. So A becomes C and C becomes E.
## Why VBS?
My school laptop is super locked down so I could only use built in languages. I couldn't figure out how to make it in batch, and I hate powershell. I could not find any docs on JScript, so VB it is.
## License
RCode (Both the software and the specification) is licensed under the Dont be a Dick Public License. In summary, dont be a Dick
